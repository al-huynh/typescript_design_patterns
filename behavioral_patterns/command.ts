/*
Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. 
This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

Applicability:
1. Use the Command pattern when you want to parameterize objects with operations.

2. Use the Command pattern when you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.

3. Use the Command pattern when you want to implement reversible operations.

The client should initialize objects in the following order:
1. Create receivers.
2. Create commands, and associate them with receivers if needed.
3. Create senders, and associate them with specific commands.
