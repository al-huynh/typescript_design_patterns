/*
State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to 
change the behavior when its internal state changes.
The State pattern suggests that you create new classes for all possible 
states of an object and extract all state-specific behaviors into these classes.

Applicability:
1. Use the State pattern when you have an object that behaves differently
depending on its current state, the number of states is enormous, and 
the state-specific code changes frequently.

2. Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive conditionals 
that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the classâ€™s fields.

3. Use State when you have a lot of duplicate code across similar states and 
transitions of a condition-based state machine.
