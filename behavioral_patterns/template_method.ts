/*
Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton 
of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps 
of the algorithm without changing its structure.

Applicability:
1. Use the Template Method pattern when you want to let clients extend only 
particular steps of an algorithm, but not the whole algorithm or its structure.

2. Use the pattern when you have several classes that contain almost identical 
algorithms with some minor differences. As a result, you might need to modify 
all classes when the algorithm changes.

For each variation of the algorithm, create a new concrete subclass. 
It must implement all of the abstract steps, but may also override some of the optional ones.
